Hardy Chrome Helper
===

It can be a hassle to create [Hardy](https://github.com/thingsinjars/GhostStory) test files initially so here's a handy Chrome Devtools Extension that will do it for you. Well, almost.

Once enabled, the extension will allow you to click on elements and choose which CSS properties you want to measure. You can do this as many times as you like and at the end, your feature file will be automatically created along with a [selector map](http://hardy.io/selector-maps.html).
